> Component testing for Svelte apps using the open source [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) E2E test runner **v4.5.0+**

![Keypad pin spec](images/pin.gif)

## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8 or above and Cypress v4.5.0+

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress-svelte-unit-test @cypress/webpack-preprocessor
```

1. Configure Cypress to use the plugin in [cypress/plugins/index.js](cypress/plugins/index.js):

```js
const webpackPreprocessor = require('@cypress/webpack-preprocessor')
module.exports = on => {
  const options = {
    // send in the options from your webpack.config.js, so it works the same
    // as your app's code
    webpackOptions: require('../webpack.config.js')
  }

  on('file:preprocessor', webpackPreprocessor(options))
}
```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Turn the experimental component support on in your `cypress.json`. You can also specify where component spec files are located. For example, to have them located in `src` folder use:

```json
{
  "experimentalComponentTesting": true,
  "componentFolder": "src"
}
```

See [cypress.json](cypress.json) in this project.

## Known issues

- uses Webpack [#53](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-svelte-unit-test/issues/53), which is different how most Svelte apps are rolled üòâ
- need to load images differently to transform relative paths

## Svelte v3

This component adaptor is meant for [Svelte v3](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity). If you need Svelte v2 support, check out branch [svelte-v2](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-svelte-unit-test/tree/svelte-v2)

## Use

Import your Svelte component and mount using the provided function. Pass [component options](https://svelte.dev/docs#Creating_a_component) and global document options (like a global CSS)

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />
import App from '../components/ChainedBalls.svelte'
import {mount} from 'cypress-svelte-unit-test'

describe('SVG animation', () => {
  it('shows chained balls', () => {
    cy.viewport(960, 500)
    const style = `
      line {
        stroke: gray;
        stroke-width: 2px;
      }
    `
    mount(App, {
      props: {
        width: 960,
        height: 500
      }
    }, { style })
    cy.get('circle').should('have.length', 50)
  })
})
```

You can use local styles, local CSS file path (relative to the the Cypress project root) or external stylesheets. See [styles example](cypress/components/styles).
